# T-G-A-deficiency-pattern
A project about "T-G-A deficiency pattern in protein-coding genes and its potential reason"

BaseFunction.py is a python package we defined which includes base functions in this paper.

CalcalateNucleotideFrequnency.py is the main program for calculating the nucleotides frequency of codon.

IMemProt.cds is an example as input file which includs the protein coding genes (input file must be the fasta format)

nuclRate.txt is the results produced by the CalcalateNucleotideFrequnency.py and IMemProt.cds files.
